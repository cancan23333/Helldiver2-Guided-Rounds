-- WHAT v1.9.8 DOES - DEATH COMES FROM THE GAME, NOT FROM hp > 0
--   Enemy HP HUD Plus reads the same health manager this addon does (record
--   stride 0x1B8, hp at +0x14, descriptor [u64 type][u32 entity][u32 unit]
--   [u32 goid][u32 flags]) and the census proved the death mark is the
--   record's status word: a killed devastator read hp=0 status=2, every
--   live body status=0.  So a unit that reports a non-zero status is dead,
--   and its parts - which keep hp>0 and carry the same unit id - are dropped
--   with it.  The census now also prints the unit id.
--
-- WHAT v1.9.7 FIXES - NOTHING LOCKED, AND THE SPEED OPTION NEVER ARMED
--   1. v1.9.6 tested pose_node in the block that runs BEFORE pose_node is
--      read, so it was always nil and every candidate was rejected - live
--      and dead alike.  The test now sits right after the faction read.
--   2. The seeker data block (GUIDED ROUND SPEED) was searched once, at
--      startup, which is usually before a guided round has spawned and
--      loaded its package.  A bound round now restarts the walk, up to
--      three times, so the speed option can arm later in a mission.
--      (v1.9.20: it never found that block on any build we have logs for,
--      so the walk and both speed knobs are gone - see the note where the
--      code used to be, next to dl_collect().)
--
-- WHAT v1.9.6 FIXES - THE CORPSE WAS A STRIDER'S ARMOUR PLATE
--   v1.9.5's word list missed 'Reinforced Scout Strider Fullcover', the
--   front plate that outlives the strider, so a dead strider still looked
--   lockable.  The census then showed the class test: every BODY has a pose
--   node, every prop or body part has none.  The gate now skips anything
--   without a pose node except two physical structures (the Tesla Tower and
--   the jammer's power unit), keeps the word list as the second net, and the
--   word 'Fullcover' is in it.
--
-- WHAT v1.9.5 FIXES - THE CORPSE WAS A TRUNCATED PART ROW
--   v1.9.4 skipped rows whose name contains "(Model)", but the list names
--   were generated cut at about 34 characters: "Reinforced Scout Strider
--   Rocket Rig Left (Model)" is "Reinforced Scout Strider Rocke Lef" there,
--   so the mark was gone and the part still locked after the strider died.
--   The gate now classifies by words that survive truncation ( Shield,
--   Gatling, Rocke, Repe ..., pods, backpacks, gun pods, engines), which
--   drops props and parts as a class instead of one spelling of one part.
--
-- WHAT v1.9.4 FIXES - THE CORPSE WAS A "(MODEL)" PROP ROW
--   The live census showed the culprit: 'Defeat Devastator Shield (Model)'
--   sat in the lock list with hp=800 after its devastator was dead.  Every
--   "(Model)" row is a prop or a body part that can outlive the body it
--   belongs to, so those rows are no longer lockable at all.  The census
--   now also re-logs a resource when its hp / status / flags change, so a
--   corpse transition shows up in the next log instead of being hidden.
--
-- WHAT v1.9.3 FIXES - THE v1.9.2 LIVENESS GATE REJECTED EVERYTHING
--   v1.9.2 asked Unit.alive about the handle a health record carries; that
--   binding answered false for every unit, dead or alive, so nothing could
--   be locked at all.  The gate is gone again - v1.9.1 behaviour.  The
--   corpse evidence now comes from the census instead: each resource line
--   also prints the record's flags word, so a corpse and a live body can be
--   compared before another gate is written against it.
--
-- WHAT v1.9.2 FIXES - CORPSES WERE STILL LOCKABLE
--   The candidate gates only asked "hp > 0", which a body PART satisfies
--   after the body dies: a Shield Devastator's shield kept its health and
--   stayed lockable.  Every candidate now also has to pass Unit.alive; a
--   missing or failing API counts as alive, so nothing else changes.
--
-- WHAT v1.9.1 FIXES - THE SLIDERS WERE WRITTEN BUT NEVER READ BACK
--   The cfg loader only accepted a numeric key when the key already
--   existed in the option table (`cfg[k] ~= nil`), and a per-target
--   priority is created on the fly as tp_<16 hex>.  So every slider
--   change was saved to the cfg and then ignored on the next launch,
--   which is why the numbers had to be set again every run.  A tp_
--   key is now accepted like any declared option.
--
-- WHAT v4.13 DOES - THE CLUSTER MODE GOES BACK TO FACTORY, FLAK STAYS GUIDED
--   The user asked for exactly this: put the launcher's ammunition back to
--   normal and keep the tracking on the flak round only.  Guiding the cluster
--   round is what took its burst away - the burst belongs to the round, and a
--   borrowed seeker round does not scatter the bomblets - so the cluster fire
--   mode now keeps its factory round, its factory 0.25 s fuse, its factory
--   burst and its 25 bomblets, and the bomblet row is left alone too.  Only the
--   flak fire mode gets the borrowed seeker (launcher_seeker), which is the one
--   thing that came out of all this working.  flak_only=1 is shipped; set it to
--   0 to bring the guided swarm back for people who want to experiment.
--
-- WHAT v4.12 FIXES - WE WERE PATCHING THE WRONG ROWS ENTIRELY
--   Live: "高射模式主弹药追踪但 Flak 不产生子弹药；集束模式不追踪且没有 25 颗".
--   The live log showed the two rows this addon had been writing:
--       #312  250 m/s  life 1.500 s  prox 2.00 m   <- we called it "cluster"
--       #311  140 m/s  life 10.00 s  prox 0.00 m
--   Offline says #312 is the FLAK round (type 301: life 1.5, proximity 2.0 m)
--   and #311 is not a rocket at all - it is the Male Agitator's weapon row
--   (rpm 700, type 300: calibre 10, 140 m/s, life 10 s, NO unit at +0x80).
--   So every version up to v4.11 (a) wrote the seeker onto a civilian NPC's
--   gun, (b) never touched the cluster fire mode at all, which is why the
--   cluster round stayed dumb, and (c) picked the flak round as "the cluster
--   round" because of the two rows it had, the flak one had the shorter fuse -
--   and then turned the flak round into 25 darts with no explosion left, which
--   is exactly "Flak 不产生子弹药".
--   The +576 field we took for "the other fire mode" is simply not that.
--   Both fire modes are now found the way the export proves they can be told
--   apart: theirs are the only two ProjectileSettings rows carrying the
--   launcher's projectile unit.  Cluster = the timed one (no proximity fuse),
--   flak = the proximity one.  See launcher_rows() and PL.scan() below.
--
-- WHAT v4.11 DOES - THE CLUSTER MODE BECOMES A GUIDED SWARM
--   A projectile spawned by an explosion can never carry a seeker (that is
--   structural, see the airburst section), but one spawned by a WEAPON can -
--   so stop spawning them from the explosion and let the weapon do it: num_projectiles (+0x1C) is the shotgun field and one shipped row already
--   carries 25.  The cluster burst is removed at the same time (both
--   explosion_type_on_impact +0x90 and explosion_type_expire +0x9C go to 0),
--   otherwise each of the 25 darts would detonate and spawn 25 more.  Each
--   dart keeps the borrowed seeker and is bound to its OWN enemy, taken round
--   robin over the ranked aim cone, so they fan out.  Each dart takes the
--   CLUSTER BOMBLET's DamageInfoType, so 25 guided darts hit for exactly what
--   the factory burst of 25 bomblets hit for.  swarm_count=0 restores the
--   airburst behaviour of v4.10.  The flak row is never touched.
--
-- WHAT v4.10 DOES - THE BURST NOW HAPPENS WHERE THE ROCKET ARRIVES
--   The cluster mode is a plain 0.25 SECOND TIMER, and that is the whole story
--   behind "it goes off too early".  Offline the launcher has two rocket rows:
--       Cluster  type  94  life 0.25 s  proximity 0.0  -> explosion 286 -> 25 x 227
--       Flak     type 301  life 1.50 s  proximity 2.0  -> explosion 310 -> 25 x  77
--   Same unit, same 250 m/s, and the cluster one carries NO proximity fuse at
--   all: it bursts a quarter of a second after it leaves the tube whatever it
--   borrowed, i.e. about 20 m out.  Blaming the seeker for that was wrong.
--   Now that the rocket itself homes (v4.9), the fix is obvious: give the round
--   time to fly and, optionally, the proximity fuse its sibling already has, so
--   the 25 bomblets land where it arrives.  Two fields: life_time +0x34 and
--   explosion_proximity +0x94 on the cluster rocket's own row.
--   And the bomblets themselves will never home - that is structural now, see
--   the airburst section below: in the whole export there is not one
--   ProjectileSettings row whose unit carries a SeekingMissileComponent, and
--   not one explosion that spawns such a row.
--
-- WHAT v4.9 FIXES - THE ROCKET WAS IN THE MANAGER AND WE IGNORED IT
--   v4.8 was the right idea and still did nothing, and the live log says
--   exactly why:
--     SEEK payload=96  first seen (src=653, ...)
--     SEEK payload=312 first seen (src=653, ...)
--     BURST seeking manager high=7 - payloads seen so far: 312x186 96x58 236x755
--   so the rocket really does reach the seeking manager, carrying the launcher's
--   own weapon id in its source slot - and all 33 bindings in that mission still
--   carried payload 236, the APW-1 round.  The rocket was never bound once.
--   The reason is the "is this mine?" test: it asked ctx.wset[src].leased, i.e.
--   "did WE lease a per-weapon settings row for the weapon that fired this?".
--   The launcher can never have one - two fire modes means its resource row
--   holds an alternate settings index at +576, which the lease gate rejects - so
--   ctx.wset has no entry for it and every rocket was answered with "not mine".
--   v4.9 recognises the rocket by its source weapon id instead, remembered for a
--   few seconds so a round still in flight after you holster the launcher keeps
--   its target, and binds it with the seeker entity launcher_seeker picked.
--   Second change: launcher_seeker is a SEPARATE key from cluster_seeker and
--   defaults to 0, the P-92 warrant.  With the MLS-4X commando entity the burst
--   went off far too early, which smells like the commando missile's own fuse
--   rather than the launcher's; the warrant round carries no such thing, and the
--   rocket has a source weapon, so a TargetLock seeker works on it here even
--   though it never worked on a bomblet.
--
-- WHAT v4.8 DOES - GUIDE THE ROCKET INSTEAD OF THE BOMBLETS
--   Four versions tried to give the 25 bomblets themselves a seeker.  The v4.7
--   live log closed the question: every one of its 89 bindings carried payload
--   236 (the main round), the payload census logged nothing else, and bombs=0
--   for the whole mission - even with the MLS-4X package properly resident.  The
--   burst is spawned by an explosion as lightweight ballistic projectiles: row
--   233's +0x80 decides what they look like (which is why v4.4 visibly swapped
--   them) but no actor carrying a SeekingMissileComponent is ever created, so
--   there is nothing there to home.  Swapping that field again is pointless.
--   What CAN be guided is the rocket that CARRIES the burst - it is a weapon
--   round exactly like the APW-1's, and the lease already proves those work.
--   Its own projectile row keeps the proximity fuse, so it still bursts; it just
--   bursts on top of whatever it flew into.
--   The launcher has two fire modes (Cluster and Flak), which is exactly why its
--   resource row fails the lease gate: +576 holds the index of the SECOND row.
--   So there is no per-weapon copy to write to - both factory rows are patched
--   in place.  The cost is that while this is on it applies to every RL-77 in
--   the session, not only yours, which is why it rides on cluster_guide rather
--   than being always on, and why the factory value goes straight back when you
--   drop the launcher, press F7 or leave.
--
-- WHAT v4.7 FIXED - THE FLICKER AND THE LOG FLOOD
--   The live log of v4.6 (2026-10-03) ended with 3757 pairs of
--     "READY - APW-1 located, guidance armed"
--     "WAIT settings_alternate_settings_not_zero"
--   in 54 seconds, i.e. exactly one of each PER FRAME.  Two bugs:
--   1. note() is called from inside lease(), which runs BEFORE the end of
--      step().  lease() failing did not stop step(), so the very same frame
--      printed WAIT (from lease) and then READY (from the unconditional reset
--      at the end of step()).  Every frame, forever.  Fixed by stamping the
--      frame a WAIT was raised on and only printing READY on a frame with no
--      WAIT at all, plus a 5 s cooldown on both lines so a condition that
--      genuinely flaps cannot flood the log either.
--   2. The RL-77 can never take a per-weapon settings row: its resource row
--      has a non-zero "alternate settings" pointer (it has two fire modes),
--      which the lease gate rejects.  v4.6 retried that every single frame.
--      Fixed by remembering the refusal per weapon id and skipping it.  The
--      launcher does not need the lease anyway - it only has to be in the
--      weapons= list so ctx.rl77_id is set, which is what arms the cluster
--      phase.
--   Both are pure log/state bugs, but 160 file open+write+close per second on
--   a 19 MB log inside the game's own update() is what the user saw as the
--   picture stuttering / flickering.
--   Also fixed: the MLS-4X / Patriot asset request used hd2.weapon(), which
--   only knows PRIMARY weapons.  A support weapon needs hd2.support_weapon()
--   and the exosuit hd2.vehicle(), so the bomblet seeker package was never
--   actually loaded - a bomblet that spawns with a non-resident unit has no
--   SeekingMissileComponent at all, which is the most likely reason it never
--   shows up in the seeking manager.
--   Added: every distinct runtime payload seen in the seeking manager is now
--   logged once, so the next log says outright whether the bomblet registers
--   under a different projectile type than the row we patched.
--
-- APW-1 ANTI-MATERIAL RIFLE - GUIDED ROUNDS THAT LOCK ONTO ENEMIES  (v3.0)
--
-- WHAT v1.x GOT WRONG, AND WHAT THIS VERSION DOES INSTEAD
--   v1.x tried to make the lock reticle appear by hunting two magic values
--   (ability 2541, crosshair pair 16/3) INSIDE the 616-byte settings row that
--   the P-11 Stim Homing addon edits.  The live log proved both are absent
--   there.  They are absent because that row is ProjectileWeaponComponentData:
--
--     +0x00 u32 projectile_type      +0x04..0x10 f32 rounds_per_minute (xyz)
--     +0x28 u64 projectile_entity    <- the P-11 mod writes here (offset 40)
--     ... 616 bytes total
--
--   The reticle lives in a DIFFERENT component: WeaponDataComponentData.
--
--   Offline data (Data/entities/WeaponDataComponentData.json, build 1.006.301):
--
--                       crosshair_type   secondary_crosshair_type
--     P-92 Warrant            16 (=Javelin)      16 (=Javelin)
--     P-33 Missile Pistol     16                 16
--     FAF-14 Spear            16                  0
--     StA-X3 W.A.S.P.         16                  0
--     AR-23 Liberator          4                  0
--     BR-14 Adjudicator        4                  0
--     R-63CS Diligence CS      4                  0
--     APW-1 Anti-Materiel      3                  0
--
--   Every weapon in the game that can lock on has crosshair_type 16
--   (CrosshairWeaponType_Javelin).  The APW-1 has 3.  THAT is the missing
--   piece, and it is not in the row v1.x was editing.
--
-- WHAT THIS ADDON DOES
--   1) +0x28 of the APW's ProjectileWeaponComponentData (cloned into a
--      per-weapon instance slot so the shared resource row is untouched):
--      0 -> 0x8053DA4358971392, the P-92 Warrant projectile.  Its
--      SeekingMissileComponentData has targeting_mode = 2 (TargetLock), so the
--      engine's own lock-on pipeline applies.
--   2) crosshair_type of the APW's WeaponDataComponentData: 3 -> 16, so the
--      Javelin lock reticle is drawn and the native target lock runs.
--      The offset is NOT hardcoded: it is located at runtime by voting across
--      the eight weapons above, so it survives a layout change.
--   3) Damage: the leased round is the P-92's, whose projectile settings row
--      carries DamageInfoType 90.  The APW-1's own round carries 199.  This
--      addon writes 199 over 90 for as long as it is armed, so the APW-1 keeps
--      its vanilla damage.  Restored on disarm / shutdown.
--   4) Fallback: if the engine does not bind a target by itself, this addon
--      binds one (aim cone, enemies only) to the projectile as it spawns,
--      exactly like the published P-11 Stim Homing addon.
--
-- WHAT v3.4 ADDS - AN ADDON-OWNED RETICLE
--   The game's own Javelin reticle could not be switched on: the
--   WeaponDataComponentData LDLD block does not exist in the live process and
--   the content-signature route never confirmed a row.  So the addon now draws
--   its own reticle with the same calls the P-11 Stim Homing addon uses for its
--   orange/green aiming circle:
--       sr.World.create_screen_gui(ui_world,'scale',1,1)
--       sr.Gui.triangle(gui, a, b, c, 100, sr.Color(...))
--   As of v3.5 that attempt is abandoned and the option is OFF by default: the
--   log proved the addon cannot reach the stingray screen-gui API in the live
--   process.  The drawing code stays in the file (dead unless reticle=1) only so
--   it can be retried later; nothing in the guidance pipeline depends on it.

-- WHAT v4.4 ADDS - RL-77 AIRBURST CLUSTER BOMBLETS GET THE SAME SEEKER
--   The launcher has two fire modes and they are ONE settings row:
--       projectile_type                = 301   flak:   life 1.5 s, proximity 2.0
--                                                      -> blast 310 -> 25 x type 77
--       weapon_function_projectile_type=  94   cluster: life 0.25 s
--                                                      -> blast 286 -> 25 x type 227
--   Type 227 is the CLUSTER BOMBLET: calibre 40, speed 25, mass 100,
--   gravity 4.0, life_time 0.0, arming 1.0.  Nothing else in the game spawns it
--   (one explosion row points at it, no weapon fires it), so it can be patched
--   in place instead of cloned.
--   Two writes make it a guided round:
--     +0x80 projectile_unit_path -> the P-92 Warrant projectile entity, the same
--           entity the lease installs.  That is where SeekingMissileComponentData
--           lives; the bomblet keeps its own ProjectileSettings row, so its
--           damage (270) and its blast (7) stay the vanilla ones.
--     +0x34 life_time 0.0 -> cluster_life.  The factory value is zero, and a
--           homing round that never expires is the known leak.
--   They are then bound like any other round, to the target the launcher itself
--   is aiming at (its last lock if there was one, otherwise its own muzzle cone),
--   so all 25 bomblets converge on the thing you locked instead of scattering.
--
-- WHAT v4.6 FIXES - THE BOMBLET SEEKS NOTHING BECAUSE IT HAS NO WEAPON TO LOCK
--   WITH.  Live log, one whole mission with the patch applied: 79 bindings and
--   every one of them payload=236, the main rocket.  Not one bomblet - the type
--   the row carries - ever registered in the seeking manager, bombs=0 from start
--   to finish.  The write itself is fine (the row read back with the new unit),
--   so the seeker is the problem, not the patch: the P-92 warrant seeker runs
--   SeekingMissileTargetingMode 2 = TargetLock, and the whole v4.4 idea of
--   "bomblets chase the launcher lock" needs a lock SOURCE.  A bomblet is
--   spawned by an explosion; there is no weapon behind it, so nothing ever
--   offers it a target and the seeker never switches on.
--   The fix is a seeker that acquires by itself.  Offline the game ships 27
--   SeekingMissileComponentData entities and four targeting modes; the two rows
--   with movement_should_be_processed_by_projectile_system = 1 (the MLS-4X
--   commando missile and the Patriot exosuit rocket, both Guidance) are seekers
--   built to steer a PROJECTILE rather than to fly a missile themselves, which
--   is exactly the shape of a bomblet, so they lead the list.
--   The G-50 Seeker grenade cannot be used as the template: its hash
--   0x2D398D1EC35E0838 appears in the offline export once, as an
--   ExplosiveComponentData with mode 2 = ExplosiveMode_External, and no
--   ProjectileSettings row points at it.  It is an actor with its own AI, not a
--   projectile, so there is no component to transplant.
--   cfg.cluster_seeker now picks one of eight; cluster_autofix stops an old cfg
--   that still says 0 from silently using the one seeker that cannot work.

-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ launcher
-- Guiding the CARRIER instead of the bomblets.
-- Four versions tried to make the 25 bomblets themselves home and every one of
-- them came back with the same live evidence - payload 236 (the main round) and
-- nothing else ever appears in the seeking manager, bombs=0 for the whole
-- mission.  That is consistent with the burst being spawned by the projectile
-- system as lightweight ballistic projectiles: row 233's +0x80 decides what they
-- LOOK like (which is why v4.4 visibly swapped them) but no actor with a
-- SeekingMissileComponent is ever created for them, so there is nothing to home.
--
-- The rocket that carries the burst is a different story - it is a weapon round
-- exactly like the APW-1's, and the APW-1 lease proves those can be swapped.  Its
-- own projectile row keeps the proximity fuse, so it still bursts; it just bursts
-- on top of whatever it flew into.
--
-- The launcher has two fire modes (Cluster and Flak), which is exactly why its
-- resource row fails the lease gate: +576 != 0 means it owns an ALTERNATE row,
-- and that field holds the second row's index.  There is no per-weapon copy to
-- write to, so both factory rows are patched in place.  Cost of that: while this
-- is on it applies to every RL-77 in the session, not only yours.  It is why the
-- phase rides on the same cluster_guide switch instead of being always on, and
-- why the factory value is put back the moment you drop the launcher or press F7.
-- v4.12: +576 IS NOT THE OTHER FIRE MODE.  Live (see the session log) it held
-- the index of a Male Agitator weapon row - rpm 700, a 140 m/s pistol round
-- whose unit is 0 - so every version up to v4.11 wrote the seeker onto a
-- civilian NPC's gun and never touched the cluster mode at all.  That is why
-- the cluster round stayed dumb ("集束模式不追踪") and why the row we called
-- "the cluster round, shortest fuse" was really the flak round: of the two rows
-- we had, the flak one (1.5 s) was simply shorter than the agitator's (10 s),
-- so the swarm was written over the flak round - "Flak 不产生子弹药".
--
-- The two fire modes are found the way the export proves they can be told
-- apart: theirs are the ONLY two ProjectileSettings rows that carry the
-- launcher's projectile unit.  Offline (1.006.301) that is unit
-- 3939411889253242210, held by type 94 (cluster: life 0.25 s, NO proximity
-- fuse) and type 301 (flak: life 1.50 s, 2.0 m) and by nothing else in the 337
-- rows.  So: seed the unit from any row the launcher's own resource hash owns,
-- then take EVERY fire mode row whose round carries that same unit.  Drift
-- proof, and it cannot pick up somebody else's weapon.

-- ------------------------------------------------------------ the airburst
-- WHY THE CLUSTER BURST GOES OFF TOO EARLY - AND WHY THE BOMBLETS NEVER HOME
-- Offline (Data/settings/generated_projectile_settings.json, 1.006.301): the
-- RL-77 has TWO rocket rows, one per fire mode, both the same unit and the same
-- 250 m/s:
--   Cluster: type  94  life 0.25 s  proximity 0.0  -> explosion 286 -> 25 x type 227
--   Flak   : type 301  life 1.50 s  proximity 2.0  -> explosion 310 -> 25 x type   77
-- Type 227 (row index 101) is the cluster bomblet: calibre 40, speed 25, mass
-- 100, gravity 4, life 0.0, arming 1 - the exact six floats this addon hunts.
--
-- So the cluster mode is a PLAIN 0.25 SECOND TIMER. There is no proximity fuse
-- and nothing about a seeker in it: the rocket bursts a quarter of a second
-- after it leaves the tube no matter what it borrowed, which is why the user
-- saw it going off far too early and why blaming the seeker's fuse was wrong.
--
-- And the bomblets cannot be made to home, now for a structural reason and not
-- only for five versions of live evidence: in the WHOLE export there is not one
-- ProjectileSettings row whose unit carries a SeekingMissileComponent, and not
-- one explosion that spawns such a row. A projectile created by an explosion is
-- a lightweight ballistic thing by construction - row 227's +0x80 only decides
-- what it LOOKS like, which is why v4.4 visibly swapped them. That is also why
-- the seeking manager never sees payload 233: our own live census says so too
--   BURST seeking manager high=N - payloads seen so far: 236x128 96x85 312x758
-- three numbers, none of them the bomblet.
--
-- What CAN be done, and it lands the same result: the rocket is guided now, so
-- let the burst happen WHERE THE ROCKET ARRIVES. Two fields do it, life_time
-- (+0x34) and explosion_proximity (+0x94), on the cluster rocket's own row.

-- v4.11: the cluster mode becomes a GUIDED SWARM instead.
-- A projectile spawned by an explosion can never home (see above), but a
-- projectile spawned by a WEAPON can - so stop spawning them from the explosion
-- and let the weapon do it: num_projectiles (+0x1C) is the shotgun field, 31
-- rows in the export use it and one of them already ships 25. The cluster burst
-- has to be taken out at the same time (both explosion_type_on_impact +0x90 and
-- explosion_type_expire +0x9C go to 0) or every one of the 25 darts would
-- detonate and spawn 25 more - 625 bomblets from one trigger pull.
-- Each dart then keeps the launcher's borrowed seeker (launcher_seeker) and is
-- bound to its OWN target, so they fan out instead of stacking on one enemy.
-- Damage: the darts take the CLUSTER BOMBLET's DamageInfoType, so a burst of 25
-- guided darts hits for exactly what the factory burst of 25 bomblets hit for.
-- The flak row is never touched - two rows, two fire modes, one change.

-- Own reticle: screen overlay + world marker
-- ===================================================================
-- HD2 draws screen overlays through its UI world with
--   sr.World.create_screen_gui(world,'scale',1,1) + sr.Gui.triangle(gui,a,b,c,100,color)
-- That is exactly what the P-11 Stim Homing addon uses for its orange/green
-- aiming circle, and it needs no weapon resource at all - so it works even
-- though we never managed to reach the APW-1 WeaponData row.
-- Rules taken from that addon (all of them are load bearing):
--   * sr is the global 'stingray'
--   * every call must run inside sr.Script.temp_byte_count / set_temp_byte_count
--     (skipping it is a known crash)
--   * the UI world is any world that is not the mission world
--   * GUI coordinates are (screenX, 0, screenY), origin at the screen centre
--   * the triangles must NOT be refreshed every frame: HD2 makes the ring vanish
--     when they are updated at a colour change.  Rebuild only when resolution,
--     colour or visibility changes.

-- v1.9.20: this file used to walk the whole address space looking for the
-- SeekingMissileComponentData block (SEEK_DL 0xBF3A6789, magic 'LDLD') so it
-- could rewrite the leased P-92 Warrant projectile's three speeds from 90 m/s
-- to whatever seek_speed said.  The block has never been resident on any build
-- we have logs for - 176 full walks, including the original author's v4.16
-- sessions, and zero hits - so the walk and both knobs (seek_speed,
-- seek_accel) are gone.  Nothing else used them: the lease, the seeker entity
-- picker (SEEK_LIST / F10 / seek_entity=), the ballistics and the fuse writes
-- are untouched.  If a future build ever exposes that block, re-add it here
-- with a bounded walk - see the v1.9.19 slicing rules in dl_collect().

-- ===================================================================
-- P3: lock reticle - range ring + lock markers
-- ===================================================================
-- THREE elements, TWO screen GUIs, and the split is load bearing:
--
--   GUI A - the RANGE RING (hand-built triangles). Triangles cannot be updated
--           in place: rebuilding them at a colour change is what makes a ring
--           vanish. So the ring lives on its own GUI and that GUI is rebuilt
--           only when its quantised radius, colour or the resolution changes.
--           Its screen radius is the aim cone half angle projected through the
--           camera's vertical FOV, so it follows LOCK ANGLE and the camera zoom.
--
--   GUI B - the LOCK MARKERS (stock Warrant bitmap quads) and, in world space,
--           the TARGET BOX. This GUI is created once and never rebuilt: the
--           quads are updated in place, which is the whole point of separating
--           it. Sharing one GUI with the ring was a bug: zooming a scope moves
--           the FOV, the ring rebuilt every frame, and the markers were
--           destroyed and recreated with it often enough to look absent.
--
-- Engine queries and GUI calls only: nothing here reads or writes process
-- memory. The ring needs no game assets, so it works before the leased Warrant
-- package is resident; the markers simply skip until it is.
